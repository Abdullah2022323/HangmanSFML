# HangmanSFML
This is the simplest hangman game you can find on the internet. This is developed by using SFML library in C++.
This is free to use only if you use it for personal use.
This is not intended for commercial use.

There are loadFromFile lines which contain addresses which need to be replaced by the address of the location of your files.
I have uploaded all the needed files, you just need to save them somewhere and then replace the address
with the address of those files.
